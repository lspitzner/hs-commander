-- | A tuple of typeclasses that must all be implemented for function parameter
-- types in order that they can be used in the functions attached to commands.
-- 'ToParam' is the only mandatory requirement ('ParamFlags' and 'ParamHelp'
-- have default defitions), however it is recommended that you implement
-- 'ParamHelp' in all cases, and you must implement 'ParamFlags' if you want
-- your new type to match against provided flags. An example custom parameter
-- implementation:
--
-- > data Verbose = Verbose Bool
-- >
-- > instance ParamFlags Verbose where
-- >     paramFlags _ = Just ["v", "verbose"]
-- > instance ParamHelp Verbose where
-- >     paramHelp _ = "Make the command more verbose"
-- > instance ToParam Verbose where
-- >     toParam (Just _) = Right (Verbose True)
-- >     toParam Nothing = Right (Verbose False)
--
-- Here, we define a @Verbose@ type that will equal @Verbose True@ if the "v"
-- or "verbose" flag is used in the command, or @Verbose False@ otherwise.
--
-- To extract the value, all we have to do is use @(Verbose b)@ in our commands
-- function now, where @b@ will be either @True@ or @False@.
--
-- See 'Commander.Params' for the definitions of the provided 'Value' and 'Flag'
-- parameter types.
